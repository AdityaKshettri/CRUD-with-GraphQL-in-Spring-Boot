# CRUD-with-GraphQL-in-Spring-Boot
In this project, I have worked on Spring boot to create CRUD APIs using GraphQL.

# How to run this project :

1- Request Body for query : (example)

query {

    findAllBooks {
    
        id
        
        title
        
        description
        
        author {
        
            id
            
            name
            
            age
            
        }
        
    }
    
    findAllAuthors {
    
        id
        
        name
        
        age
        
    }
    
}

2- Request Body for mutation : (example)

mutation {

    createAuthor(name: "Adi", age: 25) {
    
        id
        
        name
        
        age
        
    }
    
}
